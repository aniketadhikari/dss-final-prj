# Final Project - Web Decision Support System
_Created by Aniket Adhikari, John DuBois, Rohan Krishnan, and Millie Tran for Professor Dickhan's BIT 4444 - Web Based DSS_

The objective of this project is to analyze, design, and implement a web based Decision Support System. You and your team have been contracted to help create a DSS for a business to help the end user in making a business. You need to deliver a completed DSS that the users can use easily. [The project will need to solve the final PROMPT from the ðŸ”· Project Proposal & API Connections [GRADED]]

The following technologies MUST be used to complete your Decision Support System
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (or any responsive web design framework)
* JavaScript
* APIs
## Requirements
The decision support system should included at least 5 different pages that can can be used to aid the end users in making business decisions.

### DESIGN: HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

The decision support system should be well design with the user interface and user experience as a top priority. The user interface should prevent the user from inputting invalid data, give them easy to use controls, and use a variety of components to best display data and vital information to the user. 

The DSS should included at least:
* 5 different functional CSS classes
* 3 different Bootstrap components (Links to an external site.) for displaying information (ei. Cards, Accordions, Alerts)
* 2 HTML forms
* Page Headers with Navigation [The navigation should indicate what page you are on]
* Page Footer with contact information
* Static image on the page

In addition, the pages should be good color combinations and titled properly. 

### FUNCTIONALITY: Bootstrap/JavaScript/APIs

The decision support system should be functional. This will require front-end coding to make it functional and allow the end user to calculate, optimize, analyze some part of the data. 

The DSS should include at least:
* 5 instances of Display Data (JSON -> HTML Elements)
* 2 sets of data stored in Google, Excel, etc. (pseudo database)
* 1 data score should include URLs for images to be displayed dynamically (ei. Product image, User avatar)
* 3 dynamically assigning classes based on user interaction
* 1 instance of data sorting
* 2 instances of a GET API Call to pull data in
* 2 instance of a POST API Call to update data
* 1 instance of a POST API Call to optimize, analyze, or calculate
* 1 instance of a POST API Call should trigger an external notification
* Validation on HTML forms

## Deliverables 
### Website
You and your team will deliver the DSS to the client in the form of a zipped solution. All the HTML, CSS, Images, and JS should be included. 

### APIs
The APIs will need to be shared with the client (jdickhan@vt.edu) - Named GROUPXX-Name of API

### Data sources
The data sources will need to be shared with the client (jdickhan@vt.edu) as well - Named GROUPXX-Name of Data Source
